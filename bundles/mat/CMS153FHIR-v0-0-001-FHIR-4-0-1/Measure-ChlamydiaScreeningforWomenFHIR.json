  "rationale": "Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection in the U.S., resulting in roughly 1.7 million cases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Chlamydia infections are often asymptomatic, but, if left untreated, can lead to serious and irreversible complications (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2014; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). \n\nWomen are particularly vulnerable when infected with chlamydia. Left untreated, chlamydia can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to chronic pelvic pain or infertility. Pregnant women may also transmit the infection to their infant, potentially resulting in neonatal pneumonia (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019).",
  "clinicalRecommendationStatement": "U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2014) recommends screening for chlamydia in sexually active females aged 24 years or younger and in older women who are at increased risk for infection (B recommendation)",

  "guidance": "Codes to identify sexually active women include codes for: pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, contraceptives or contraceptive devices, and infertility treatments.\n\nThe denominator exclusion does not apply to patients who qualify for the initial population (IP) based on services other than the pregnancy test alone. These other services include services for sexually transmitted infections, contraceptives or contraceptive devices and infertility treatments. For example, a patient who has both a pregnancy test and a chlamydia diagnosis, either of which would qualify them for the IP, would not be eligible for this denominator exclusion.\n\nPatient self-report for procedures as well as diagnostic studies should be recorded in 'Procedure, Performed' template or 'Diagnostic Study, Performed' template in QRDA-1. Patient self-report is not allowed for laboratory tests.\n\nThis eCQM is a patient-based measure.\n\nThis version of the eCQM uses QDM version 5.5.
